# Portfolio
A collection of projects/assignments I had an opportunity to be a part of during my Bachelor's/Master's years in UCF.

# Pacman Berkley Project
- Solutions to the ai.berkley pacman project. All the source code is taken directly from the ai.berkley website, and the blanks were
  filled in by me. To run a particular part, just run the autograder.py within the folder.
- Part 1 : DFS, BFS, UCS, A* and heuristics
- Part 2 : Reflex Agents, MiniMax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, Expectimax
- Part 3 : Value Iteration and Q-learning
- Still working on parts 4,5,6

# Minor Problems:
- Concurrent stacks: Lock-free, Descriptor-based and Elimination-backoff based.
