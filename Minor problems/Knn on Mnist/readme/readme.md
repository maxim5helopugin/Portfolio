# KNN classifier
- To run, just type "python knn.py"
- The data folder needs to reside in the same directory as the "knn.py"
- Due to an enormous amount of execution time, there is a test section in the code, to run the classifier on a subset of the data
- To run it on the subset, uncomment the necessary lines in the main function
